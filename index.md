## Overview and Topics
Hate and harassment has transformed the types of security and privacy threats that people experience online. Threats include toxic content where attackers attempt to silence voices; content leakage such as doxxing and non-consensual intimate imagery where attackers weaponize the distribution of private information or images; surveillance and stalking where attackers coerce and control intimate partners; and a variety of other technology-mediated attacks.

SecHOPE serves as a cross-disciplinary forum for experts to present research and share experiences with designing systems that protect people from online hate and harassment, in whatever form it takes shape. We solicit proposals for original talks that highlight new understandings of attacks, protective practices, and barriers that impede people from staying safe from hate and harassment. Submission topics include, but are not limited to:

* Hate and harassment tactics
* Attacker coordination, motivation, and behaviors
* Content moderation
* Technology-mediated protections
* Socio-technical protections
* Technological affordances for harassment
* Ad hoc protective behaviors, such as self-censorship
* Experiences and strategies of at-risk communities and individuals
* Multidisciplinary approaches to hate and harassment research


## Submission guidelines
Submissions must comply with the following rules:
* Submissions can be previously peer-reviewed full papers (maximum 18 pages), abstracts (maximum 2 pages), or the expected presentation slides.
* Submissions must be provided in PDF format.
* Submissions must be non-anonymous.
* Submissions must clearly specify which author will give the talk. The author identified commits to present the talk at the workshop.
* We welcome submissions of talks based on research previously published or presented in other venues, but we require that authors include a statement concerning whether the talk will overlap with other publications or presentations, and to what extent, and the value of presenting the work in this venue. 

Submissions that violate any of the above rules will be desk rejected.

Submissions are due by February 21, 2022.

Authors will be notified of decisions by March 23, 2022.
