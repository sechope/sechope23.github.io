## Overview and topics

Hate and harassment has transformed the types of security and privacy threats that people experience online. Threats include toxic content where attackers attempt to silence voices; content leakage such as doxxing and non-consensual intimate imagery where attackers weaponize the distribution of private information or images; surveillance and stalking where attackers coerce and control intimate partners; and a variety of other technology-mediated attacks.

SecHOPE serves as a cross-disciplinary forum for experts to present research and share experiences with designing systems that protect people from online hate and harassment, in whatever form it takes shape. We solicit proposals for original talks that highlight new understandings of attacks, protective practices, and barriers that impede people from staying safe from hate and harassment. Submission topics include, but are not limited to:

* Hate and harassment tactics
* Attacker coordination, motivation, and behaviors
* Content moderation
* Technology-mediated protections
* Socio-technical protections
* Technological affordances for harassment
* Ad hoc protective behaviors, such as self-censorship
* Experiences and strategies of at-risk communities and individuals
* Multidisciplinary approaches to hate and harassment research
