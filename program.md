A detailed program, which includes an industry panel, an academic keynote, 
and sessions for breakout discussions and lightning talks, will be posted 
soon.  For now, here is a list of accepted papers, with the speaker indicated 
in bold.

1. Can’t Keep Them Away: The Failures of Anti-Stalking Protocols in Personal Item Tracking Devices\
   **Kieron Ivy Turk**, Alice Hutchings, Alastair R. Beresford\
   University of Cambridge
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

   Personal item tracking devices are popular for locating lost items such as
keys, wallets, and suitcases. These devices are now being abused by stalkers
and domestic abusers to track their victims' locations over time, and some
device manufacturers created `anti-stalking features' in response. We analyse
the effectiveness of the anti-stalking features with five brands of tracking
devices through a gamified naturalistic quasi-experiment in collaboration with
the Assassins' Guild student society. Despite participants knowing they might
be tracked, and being incentivised to detect and remove the tracker, the
anti-stalking features were rarely used. We then explore common
implementations of these anti-stalking features and analyse their limitations
directly. We identify several failures of each of the features that prevent
them from performing their intended purpose even if they were in use. These
failures combined imply a need to greatly improve the presence of
anti-stalking features to prevent trackers from being abused.

2. Understanding the Behaviors of Toxic Accounts on Reddit\
   **Deepak Kumar**, Jeff Hancock, Kurt Thomas, Zakir Durumeric\
   Stanford University, Google
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
    Toxic content is the top form of hate and harassment experienced
    online. While many studies have investigated the types of toxic
    content posted online, the effects that such content has on people,
    and the impact of potential defenses, no study has captured the
    behaviors of the accounts that engage in this behavior or how such
    attacks are operationalized. In this talk, we will present a measurement
    study of 929K accounts that post toxic comments on Reddit over an
    18 month period. Combined, these accounts posted over 14 million
    toxic comments that encompass insults, identity attacks, threats
    of violence, and sexual harassment. We will explore the impact that
    these accounts have on Reddit, the targeting strategies that abusive
    accounts adopt, and the distinct patterns that distinguish classes of
    abusive accounts. Our analysis can inform the nuanced interventions
    needed to curb unwanted toxic behaviors online.

3. Financial Abuse in Intimate Partnerships: Enabling Platform Resilience and Prevention\
   **Arkaprabha Bhattacharya**, Rosanna Bellini, Kevin Lee, Vineeth Ravi, Jessica Staddon\

4. Anti-Privacy and Anti-Security Advice on TikTok: Case Studies of Technology-Enabled Surveillance and Control in Intimate Partner and Parent-Child Relationships\
   **Miranda Wei**, Eric Zeng, Tadayoshi Kohno, Franziska Roesner\
   University of Washington, Carnegie Mellon University

5. Hate Raids on Twitch: Echoes of the Past, New Modalities, and Implications for Platform Governance\
   **Catherine Han**, Joseph Seering, Deepak Kumar, Jeffrey T. Hancock, Zakir Durumeric\
   Stanford University

6. SnuggleSense: empowering online harm survivors through a sensemaking process\
   **Sijia Xiao**, Amy Mathews, Jingshu Rui, Coye Cheshire, Niloufar Salehi\
   UC Berkeley
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

   Interpersonal harm is a prevalent problem on social media platforms. Survivors are often left out of the traditional content moderation process and face uncertainty and risk of secondary harm when seeking outside help. Our research aims to empower survivors in a critical and early stage in addressing harm --- the sensemaking process. we developed SnuggleSense, a tool that empowers survivors by guiding them through a reflective sensemaking process inspired by restorative justice practices. Our evaluation found that SnuggleSense empowers participants by expanding their options for addressing harm beyond traditional content moderation methods, helping them understand their needs for restoration and healing, and increasing their engagement and emotional support in addressing harm for their friends. We discuss the implications of these findings, including the importance of providing guidance, agency and information in survivors' sensemaking of harm, as well as the educational effect of the reflection process within online communities.

7. Account Security Interfaces: Important, Unintuitive, and Untrustworthy\
   Alaa Daffalla, **Marina Bohuk**, Nicola Dell, Rosanna Bellini, Thomas Ristenpart\
   Cornell University, Cornell Tech
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

   Online services increasingly rely on user-facing interfaces to communicate important security-related account information---for example, which devices are logged into a user’s account and when recent logins occurred. However, there has been no investigation into whether these interfaces work well.
    We begin to fill this gap by partnering with a clinic that supports survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV). We perform qualitative analysis on interview transcripts between clinic consultants and survivors seeking to infer the security status of survivor accounts. Our findings show that these interfaces suffer from a number of limitations that cause confusion and reduce their utility.
    We then experimentally investigate the lack of integrity of information contained in device lists and session activity logs for four major services. For all the services investigated, we show how an attacker can either hide accesses entirely or spoof access details to hide illicit logins from victims.
