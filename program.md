1. Canâ€™t Keep Them Away: The Failures of Anti-Stalking Protocols in Personal Item Tracking Devices\
   **Kieron Ivy Turk**, Alice Hutchings, Alastair R. Beresford\
   University of Cambridge
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

   Personal item tracking devices are popular for locating lost items such as
keys, wallets, and suitcases. These devices are now being abused by stalkers
and domestic abusers to track their victims' locations over time, and some
device manufacturers created `anti-stalking features' in response. We analyse
the effectiveness of the anti-stalking features with five brands of tracking
devices through a gamified naturalistic quasi-experiment in collaboration with
the Assassins' Guild student society. Despite participants knowing they might
be tracked, and being incentivised to detect and remove the tracker, the
anti-stalking features were rarely used. We then explore common
implementations of these anti-stalking features and analyse their limitations
directly. We identify several failures of each of the features that prevent
them from performing their intended purpose even if they were in use. These
failures combined imply a need to greatly improve the presence of
anti-stalking features to prevent trackers from being abused.

   **Sijia Xiao**, Amy Mathews, Jingshu Rui, Coye Cheshire, Niloufar Salehi\
   UC Berkeley
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

   Interpersonal harm is a prevalent problem on social media platforms. Survivors are often left out of the traditional content moderation process and face uncertainty and risk of secondary harm when seeking outside help. Our research aims to empower survivors in a critical and early stage in addressing harm --- the sensemaking process. we developed SnuggleSense, a tool that empowers survivors by guiding them through a reflective sensemaking process inspired by restorative justice practices. Our evaluation found that SnuggleSense empowers participants by expanding their options for addressing harm beyond traditional content moderation methods, helping them understand their needs for restoration and healing, and increasing their engagement and emotional support in addressing harm for their friends. We discuss the implications of these findings, including the importance of providing guidance, agency and information in survivors' sensemaking of harm, as well as the educational effect of the reflection process within online communities.
